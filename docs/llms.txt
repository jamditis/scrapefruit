Scrapefruit is a Python web application for web scraping with a visual
interface. It features a multi-method cascade scraping system that automatically
falls back between scraping methods when one fails or content is blocked.

Key features:
- Cascade scraping: HTTP, Playwright, Puppeteer, Agent-browser, Browser-use
- Anti-bot bypass with Playwright-stealth for Cloudflare, CAPTCHAs, rate limiting
- Poison pill detection for paywalls, dead links, and login walls
- Local LLM integration via Ollama for summarization and entity extraction
- Video transcription from YouTube, Twitter/X, TikTok via yt-dlp and Whisper
- Vision/OCR fallback using Tesseract when DOM extraction fails
- Google Sheets export and markdown report generation
- 195+ tests covering unit, integration, and stress scenarios
